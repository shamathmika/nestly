            <p>
                Nestly was founded with one goal: to simplify the student
                housing experience. We understand the challenges students face
                when searching for safe, affordable, and convenient living
                spaces. Thatâ€™s why Nestly offers curated listings, verified
                landlord partnerships, and personalized roommate matching.

                housing advocates who believe every student deserves a place
                they can truly call home.
