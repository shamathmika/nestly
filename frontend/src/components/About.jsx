            <p>
                Nestly was founded with one goal: to simplify the student
                housing experience. We understand the challenges students face
                when searching for safe, affordable, and convenient living
                spaces. That’s why Nestly offers curated listings, verified
                landlord partnerships, and personalized roommate matching.
